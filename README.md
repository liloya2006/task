# Member Club

Tasks that are implemented in my site code.

1. My Program works as an HTTP server
2. Member is described by his name, email, and registration date. Registration date is being defined automatically when the user adds a new member to the Club
3. Member’s email is unique. If a user tries to add a member with an email that is already presented in the Club, the application rejects the request and shows an appropriate error. 
4. All data is stored in the application memory and disappeared when the application is restarted (no database needed). 
5. Member’s name (English letters, dots, spaces) and email formats are validated. 
6. The application logs incoming requests and returned responses.


To run my program you need to run main.go in cmd.exe and follow the link http://localhost:8080/
